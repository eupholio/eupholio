# Roadmap

## Near term

1. Implement rounding timing (`per_event`, `per_year`)
2. Finalize the Normalizer I/F (move exchange-specific differences outside the core)
3. Add more parity cases (error cases and large datasets)
4. Improve CI (Rust tests + parity checks)
5. Stabilize validation code operations (define backward-compatibility policy)

## Mid term

1. Improve WASM output
2. Add FIFO method (when needed)
3. Switchable fee policy

## Long term

1. Integrate with the UI layer
2. Expand exchange adapter set
